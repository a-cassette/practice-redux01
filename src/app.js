/* from Redux basic example tutorial
 * We write functional stateless components unless we need to use local state or the lifecycle methods.
 * This doesn't mean that presentational components have to be functionsâ€”it's just easier to define them this way.
 * If and when you need to add local state, lifecycle methods, or performance optimizations, you can convert them to classes.
